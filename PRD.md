# AutoReach AI – Product Requirements Document (PRD)

## 1. Overview
AutoReach AI helps candidates generate high‑quality outreach emails and assess role fit by analyzing job postings against a candidate profile. It streamlines internal job applications and increases response likelihood through targeted, AI‑assisted communication.

## 2. Goals & Non‑Goals
- Goals
  - Increase response rate to internal outreach by generating tailored emails.
  - Reduce time to assess job fit with automated match scoring and explanations.
  - Provide actionable guidance to improve CV and positioning for target roles.
- Non‑Goals
  - Full ATS integration (uploading resumes to HRIS/ATS).
  - Interview scheduling and calendar integration (future work).

## 3. Users & Personas
- Internal candidates seeking role transitions or growth.
- Hiring managers and recruiters (indirect beneficiaries via better inbound quality).

## 4. Success Metrics
- Email generation time < 30 seconds.
- 80%+ users send at least one email generated by the tool.
- 50%+ reduction in time to evaluate role fit (self‑reported).

## 5. Use Cases / User Stories
- As a candidate, I can paste a job posting and get a structured summary and requirements.
- As a candidate, I can see a match score with breakdown of matched/missing skills.
- As a candidate, I can generate an email for the hiring manager or recruiter with the right tone.
- As a candidate, I can save promising jobs to a bucket and get aggregated CV improvement advice.
- As a candidate, I can upload my CV and get prioritized suggestions to increase my match likelihood.

## 6. Features (Scope)
- Job Analysis: parsing title, department, skills, location, seniority; computing match score.
- Email Generation: templates by recipient type (HM/Recruiter), selectable tone, quick copy.
- Candidate Profile: skills, roles, experience, achievements; completeness score.
- Job Bucket: save jobs, remove, view top overlaps and gaps; live count in UI.
- CV Agent (Phase 2): CV upload, parsing, prioritized recommendations.

## 7. Functional Requirements
- Import job text; return structured fields and skills list.
- Compute match score: consider skills overlap, seniority fit, role similarity, location/remote.
- Generate email text including subject, intro, value props, relevant highlights, call‑to‑action.
- Persist bucket jobs locally (localStorage) with immediate UI refresh.
- Provide search, filter, and sort on suggested roles.

## 8. Non‑Functional Requirements
- Performance: perceived response under 1–2s for UI interactions; background matching can stream status.
- Reliability: graceful fallbacks (offline dataset) when API is unavailable.
- Accessibility: keyboard navigation, focus states, ARIA labels for controls.
- Security: API keys in env vars; sanitize inputs.

## 9. Constraints & Assumptions
- OpenAI or LLM API usage may be throttled; must support mock/offline dataset.
- Browser localStorage is sufficient for MVP persistence.

## 10. Release Plan
- v0.1: Job analysis, match scoring, email generation, profile basics.
- v0.2: Job bucket, duplicate guard, search/sort, progress and skeletons.
- v0.3: CV agent upload and advice, export/email history, analytics.

## 11. Risks & Mitigations
- LLM variability → Provide templates and editing before send.
- Data privacy → Keep PII minimal and local by default.
