# Wireframes / Mockups

Use Figma (or similar) to design and export key screens as PNGs into `screenshots/`:

Recommended frames:
- Dashboard overview
- Profile setup
- Job analysis (input + extracted details)
- Suggested roles list (filters/search/sort)
- Job bucket (saved jobs)
- Email generator

Add exported images to `screenshots/` and link them in README. Example:

- screenshots/dashboard.png
- screenshots/job-analysis.png
- screenshots/job-bucket.png

Tip: keep a light and dark mode variant for portfolio polish.
